    "Test": " The image shows a group of people participating in an outdoor activity or event. They are wearing matching uniforms with a logo and numbers on them, suggesting they might be part of a team or organization. The setting appears to be a field or park with grass and some trees in the background. There is no visible text in the image. The style of the image seems candid and possibly taken during a break in activities, as it captures a moment where the group is not actively engaged in the event. "
