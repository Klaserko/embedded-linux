    "Test": " The image appears to be a photograph of an outdoor scene, possibly during the daytime. There is a person wearing a white t-shirt and dark shorts, standing in front of a green area with some trees or shrubs. The person seems to be in motion, as suggested by the blurred background and the action captured in the image.\n\nThe image has some text overlay on it, which includes the URL \"http://localhost/emli-team-18/\", indicating that this may have been taken from a local server or development environment. Additionally, there is a timestamp that reads \"2024-05-12\" and what appears to be a file name \"152233_779.jpg\".\n\nThe style of the image suggests it might have been taken with a smartphone or a digital camera, as the composition is casual and not highly stylized or professional in nature.
